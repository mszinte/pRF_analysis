## About
---
Experiment in which we use pink noise different filtered to display specific <br/>
range of spatial frequency and contrast levels to determine the neural Contrast <br/>
Sensitivity Function (nCSF) of visual cortical areas. Participants are instructed<br/>
to fixate and report an orientation of the noise pattern presented on every TR.
